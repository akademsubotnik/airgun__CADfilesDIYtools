Airguns are guns which launch projectiles out a barrel with the force of pressurized gas.  This means that once the pressurized gas system is created the gun is ready to use.  All that will need to be done after this is to get a projectile (metal ball) of adequite size.  Firearms on the other hand require two systems, the gun desgin, as well as the cartridge/bullet design.  The main difference being that firearm bullets require primer and powder in order to fire.  For a DIY project these can't be overlooked, for every bullet you will need to add powder and a primer, HOW? Because of this it is in my opinion that airguns are a much more reasonable undertaking for a DIY gunsmithing.
